# Ray Serve Implementation

This directory contains the Ray Serve-based implementation of the agentic customer support system.

## Architecture

The system uses Ray Serve with a deployment graph that orchestrates the pipeline:

1. **Ticket Ingestion**: HTTP endpoint receives tickets
2. **Intent Classification**: Classifies ticket intent and urgency
3. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant information from knowledge base
4. **Response Generation**: Generates response using LLM
5. **Response Validation**: Validates response quality using LLM judge
6. **Response Formatting**: Formats and finalizes response
7. **Escalation Handling**: Routes to human agent if needed
