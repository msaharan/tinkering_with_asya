# Asya Implementation

This directory contains the Asya-based implementation of the agentic customer support system.

## Architecture

The system uses Asya's actor framework with the following actors:

1. **ticket-ingester**: Receives and validates incoming tickets
2. **intent-classifier**: Classifies ticket intent and urgency
3. **knowledge-retriever**: Retrieves relevant information from knowledge base
4. **response-generator**: Generates response using LLM
5. **response-validator**: Validates response quality using LLM judge
6. **response-formatter**: Formats and finalizes response
7. **escalation-handler**: Handles escalation to human agents
